# 🧠 Smart Repository Analyzer (Multi-LLM Ready)

## 📌 Problem Statement
Single-LLM tools used for understanding large GitHub repositories often produce hallucinated or incomplete answers, making them unreliable for productivity-critical tasks like code understanding and architectural analysis.

## 💡 Solution
This project is an **AI-powered GitHub Repository Analyzer** designed to evolve into a **Multi-LLM Consensus Engine**.  
It analyzes repositories, retrieves relevant context, and answers user questions reliably by laying the foundation for multi-model agreement instead of single-model dependency.
